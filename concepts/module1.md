## üìù Lecture Notes  

### 1. Introduction to SRE  

**Definition:**  
SRE applies **software engineering** to IT operations. The core idea: treat **operations problems as software problems**.  

**Key Goals:**  
- Reduce manual work (toil).  
- Improve **reliability, scalability, and efficiency**.  
- Provide a measurable framework for system health.  

**Origins at Google:**  
- Created in **2003** by **Ben Treynor Sloss**.  
- Needed to run **planet-scale systems** like Search, Gmail, and Ads.  
- Introduced: error budgets, blameless postmortems, reduction of toil.  

**SRE vs. DevOps:**  
- **DevOps:** philosophy ‚Üí break silos, improve collaboration.  
- **SRE:** concrete engineering discipline ‚Üí measure reliability, apply automation.  

| Aspect          | DevOps (Culture)                | SRE (Discipline)                   |  
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|  
| Goal            | Speed, collaboration            | Reliability, scalability            |  
| Practices       | CI/CD, pipelines, automation    | SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, postmortems|  
| Measurement     | Mostly qualitative              | Strict quantitative (SLIs/SLOs)     |  

**Roles in SRE Teams:**  
- **Reliability Engineer:** ensure service uptime.  
- **Incident Commander:** manages outages.  
- **Tooling Engineer:** builds automation.  
- **Observability Engineer:** enables monitoring and insights.

### 2. Core Concepts in SRE  

**SLI (Service Level Indicator):**  
- *Definition:* Quantitative measure of system performance.  
- *Examples:*  
  - % of successful HTTP requests.  
  - p95 latency of API calls.  
  - Error rate < 0.01%.  

**SLO (Service Level Objective):**  
- *Definition:* Target value for an SLI over time.  
- *Example:* 99.9% success rate for checkout API over 30 days.  

**SLA (Service Level Agreement):**  
- *Definition:* External contract with customers.  
- *Example:* ‚ÄúWe guarantee 99% uptime. If not, credits are issued.‚Äù  

**Composite SLOs:**  
- Aggregate multiple SLIs.  
- Example: Checkout service =  
  - Frontend latency < 200ms  
  - Payment API availability > 99.9%  
  - Error rate < 0.5%  

> **Trainer Note:** Common pitfall ‚Üí Teams confuse **SLOs (internal)** with **SLAs (external contracts)**. Stress this difference.  

---

### 3. Error Budgeting  

**Concept:**  
- Every service has a reliability *target*.  
- The ‚Äúbudget‚Äù = allowable *unreliability*.  

**Formula:**  
```

Error Budget = 100% - SLO

```

**Example:**  
- SLO: 99.9% uptime  
- Error Budget = 0.1% downtime (~43 mins/month).  

**Benefits:**  
- Balances reliability vs innovation.  
- Gives business leaders a decision framework:  
  - If budget left ‚Üí release new features.  
  - If budget exhausted ‚Üí freeze releases, fix reliability.  

**Advanced Use:**  
- *Error Budget Policy*: Formal rules when budgets are consumed.  
- *Error Budget Burn Rates*: Track how quickly the budget is spent.

### 4. Monitoring & Observability  

**Monitoring:**  
- Detects known failure conditions.  
- Example: ‚ÄúCPU > 90% for 5 min.‚Äù  

**Observability:**  
- Helps explain *unknown issues*.  
- Powered by **logs, metrics, traces**.  

**Golden Signals (must-monitor metrics):**  
1. **Latency** ‚Äì how long requests take.  
2. **Traffic** ‚Äì demand volume.  
3. **Errors** ‚Äì failure rate.  
4. **Saturation** ‚Äì resource usage limits.  

**Tools:**  
- **Prometheus + Grafana** (metrics & visualization).  
- **ELK/EFK stack** (logs).  
- **Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry** (traces).  

**Alert Fatigue:**  
- Too many alerts ‚Üí engineers ignore them.  
- Solutions:  
  - Tie alerts to **SLO violations**.  
  - Suppress noise.  
  - Automate escalations.  

**AI/ML in Observability:**  
- Detect anomalies before they cause outages.  
- Correlate cross-service failures.  
- Enable proactive incident response.

### 5. Incident Management  

**What is an Incident?**  
Unplanned event disrupting a service.  

**Goals:**  
- Detect quickly.  
- Resolve fast.  
- Learn from it.  

**Incident Lifecycle:**  
1. **Preparation**  
2. **Detection & Analysis**  
3. **Mitigation**  
4. **Resolution**  
5. **Postmortem**  

**Severity Levels:**  
- Sev 1: Major outage, high customer/business impact.  
- Sev 2: Partial degradation.  
- Sev 3: Minor issue, low impact.  
- Sev 4: Cosmetic / informational.  

**Blameless Postmortems:**  
- Ask ‚Äú*What happened?*‚Äù not ‚Äú*Who caused it?*‚Äù.  
- Focus on process, not blame.  
- Document root cause, timeline, fixes, and prevention.  

**Metrics:**  
- **MTTD**: Mean Time to Detect.  
- **MTTA**: Mean Time to Acknowledge.  
- **MTTR**: Mean Time to Resolve.  
- **MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures.  

**Automation Examples:**  
- Auto-healing services.  
- Auto traffic rerouting.  
- Auto-scaling.

### 6. Toil Reduction  

**Definition:**  
Manual, repetitive, automatable tasks that don‚Äôt scale.  

**Characteristics:**  
- Repetitive  
- Manual  
- Automatable  
- No long-term value  

**Why reduce toil?**  
- Toil grows linearly with system size.  
- Prevents engineers from working on innovation.  

**Strategies:**  
- Automate everything possible.  
- Use IaC (Terraform, Ansible, etc.).  
- Implement self-healing services.  

---

### 7. SRE Culture  

**Principles:**  
- Reliability is a *feature*.  
- Failure is an opportunity to learn.  
- Shared responsibility between Dev & Ops.  
- Engineering-driven ops: ‚ÄúOps work should look like code.‚Äù  

**Implementing SRE at Scale:**  
- Start with SLOs for critical services.  
- Establish error budgets.  
- Build automation first, not afterthought.  
- Make postmortems mandatory.
