## 1. Introduction to Reliability Engineering  
- Ensures systems are dependable, consistent, and resilient.  
- SRE blends **operations + software engineering** to sustain reliability while enabling innovation.  
- Reliability Engineering is **not about zero incidents**, but about:  
  - Designing for **failure tolerance**.  
  - Responding **fast** when things break.  
  - Learning and **improving continuously**.  

---

## 2. Principles of Reliability Engineering  

- **Automate Everything** â†’ reduce human error, speed recovery.  
- **Define & Measure SLOs** â†’ clear targets for availability/latency/error rates.  
- **Implement Error Budgets** â†’ balance innovation and stability.  
- **Build Robust Incident Management** â†’ rapid detection and response.  
- **Foster a Blameless Culture** â†’ focus on system/process, not people.  
- **Invest in Observability** â†’ metrics, logs, traces for deep insights.  
- **Focus on Simplicity** â†’ simple systems fail less.  
- **Continuous Improvement** â†’ iterate from incidents and metrics.  

---

## 3. Principles for Resilient Systems  

- **Fault Tolerance** â†’ systems keep working despite component failure.  
- **Graceful Degradation** â†’ service reduces functionality instead of failing completely.  
- **Retry Mechanisms** â†’ automatic retries handle transient errors.

## 4. Deployment Strategies  

### Blue-Green Deployment  
- Maintain **two identical environments** (Blue = live, Green = standby).  
- Steps:  
  1. Deploy to Green.  
  2. Test thoroughly.  
  3. Switch traffic from Blue â†’ Green.  
  4. Rollback if issues arise.  
- **Pros:** Zero downtime, easy rollback.  
- **Cons:** Resource-intensive.  

### Canary Deployment  
- Gradually release to a **small subset of users**.  
- Steps:  
  1. Deploy to a small group.  
  2. Monitor results.  
  3. Expand rollout or rollback.  
- **Pros:** Early detection, reduced blast radius.  
- **Cons:** More complex monitoring & routing.

## 5. Automation in SRE  

### What Is SRE Automation?  
- Use of software/tools to **replace manual toil**.  
- Example areas: provisioning, deployments, scaling, recovery.  

### Why Automate?  
- Reduce manual errors.  
- Increase speed & repeatability.  
- Free engineers for innovation.  

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Define infra with code for repeatability.  
- **Benefits:** consistency, reliability, faster recovery.  
- **Popular Tools:** Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Pulumi, Kubernetes YAML.  

### Configuration Management  
- Ensure consistent system state across environments.  
- **Key Components:** identification, control, verification/audit, status accounting.  
- **Best Practices:** policies, tool selection, training, continuous improvement.  

### Key Areas of Automation  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Monitoring & alerting  
- Infrastructure scaling (horizontal, vertical, predictive)  
- Incident response automation  
- Self-service automation (provisioning, access, log retrieval)

## 6. Alerting Strategy in SRE  

### Principles of Good Alerting  
- Immediate & clear (what, where, impact).  
- Reduce noise (avoid fatigue).  
- Prioritize **user impact**.  
- Trigger alerts **only when human action is needed**.  

### Alert Fatigue  
- Too many alerts â†’ engineers ignore real issues.  
- Avoid by:  
  - Severity labels (critical/warning/info).  
  - Tuning thresholds.  
  - Grouping related alerts.  
  - Regular review.  

### Actionable vs Non-Actionable  
- **Actionable:** require human intervention, affect users (e.g., checkout failing).  
- **Non-Actionable:** transient spikes, self-healing issues.  

### Alert Prioritization Framework  
- P0: Critical â€“ all users affected.  
- P1: High â€“ significant subset affected.  
- P2: Medium â€“ limited scope, moderate response.  
- P3: Low â€“ cosmetic issues.  
- P4: Informational â€“ awareness only.  

### SLO-Based Alerting  
- Alerts tied to **error budget consumption**, not raw metrics.  
- Example: alert if 30% of error budget consumed in 1 hour.  
- **Benefit:** reduces noise, focuses on user experience.

## 7. Incident Response & Postmortems  

### Incident Response Process  
1. **Detection** â†’ monitoring/alerts.  
2. **Triage** â†’ assess severity & impact.  
3. **Mitigation** â†’ short-term fix.  
4. **Investigation** â†’ root cause analysis.  
5. **Resolution** â†’ permanent fix.  
6. **Postmortem** â†’ document, learn, improve.  

### Roles & Escalation Paths  
- Primary On-Call â†’ first responder.  
- SME â†’ deep troubleshooting.  
- Team Lead â†’ coordinates.  
- Exec Leadership â†’ critical business incidents.  
- **Incident Commander** â†’ manages timeline, communication, decisions.  

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Techniques  
- **5 Whys** â†’ iterative questioning.  
- **Fishbone Diagram** â†’ categorize causes (People, Process, Tech, Environment, Management).  
- **Fault Tree Analysis** â†’ logical cause breakdown.  
- **Timeline Analysis** â†’ sequence of events.  

### Postmortem Practices  
- **Blameless** â†’ focus on system/process.  
- **Documented** â†’ incident summary, timeline, impact, root cause, corrective actions.  
- **Action-Oriented** â†’ improvements tracked & owned.  
- **Follow-Up Process:** assign owners, set deadlines, track progress, verify effectiveness.

## 8. Balancing Reliability & Innovation  

- Over-focus on **reliability** â†’ slows feature delivery.  
- Over-focus on **innovation** â†’ leads to outages.  
- **Error Budgets** create balance:  
  - Example: SLO 99.9% â†’ error budget = 0.1% downtime (~43.8 min/month).  
  - Deploy features if budget available; prioritize reliability if budget exhausted.  

---

## 9. Reliability KPIs & Pitfalls  

### Key KPIs  
- Availability % (99.9%).  
- MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve).  
- MTTD (Mean Time to Detect).  
- Automation coverage (% tasks automated).  

### Common Pitfalls  
- Manual operations â†’ error-prone.  
- Blame culture â†’ reduces learning.  
- Alert overload â†’ fatigue.  
- Skipping postmortems â†’ repeated failures.

## 10. Future Trends in Reliability Engineering  
- **AI-powered reliability** â†’ anomaly detection, predictive remediation.  
- **Advanced observability** â†’ integrated metrics, logs, traces.  
- **Serverless reliability** â†’ distributed reliability patterns.
